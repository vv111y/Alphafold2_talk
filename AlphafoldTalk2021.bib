                  challenge of biochemistry. Co-evolution methods show promise,
                  but an explicit sequence-to-structure map remains elusive.
                  Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed
                  pipelines with differentiable models optimized end-to-end
                  suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating
                  structure prediction. Here we report the first end-to-end
                  differentiable model of protein structure. The model couples
                  local and global protein structure via geometric units that
                  optimize global geometry without violating local covalent
                  chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks:
                  predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and
                  predicting known folds without structural templates. In the
                  first task the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and in
                  the second it comes within 1-2\AA; competing methods using
                  co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over
                  many years and it is likely that the differentiable approach
                  has substantial room for further improvement, with
                  applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design.},

  abstract =     {Motivation The complexes formed by binding of proteins to RNAs
                  play key roles in many biological processes, such as splicing,
                  gene expression regulation, translation and viral replication.
                  Understanding protein-RNA binding may thus provide important
                  insights to the functionality and dynamics of many cellular
                  processes. This has sparked substantial interest in exploring
                  protein-RNA binding experimentally, and predicting it
                  computationally. The key computational challenge is to
                  efficiently and accurately infer protein-RNA binding models
                  that will enable prediction of novel protein-RNA interactions
                  to additional transcripts of interest. Results We developed
                  DLPRB (Deep Learning for Protein-RNA Binding), a new deep
                  neural network (DNN) approach for learning intrinsic
                  protein-RNA binding preferences and predicting novel
                  interactions. We present two different network architectures:
                  a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural
                  network (RNN). The novelty of our network hinges upon two key
                  aspects: (i) the joint analysis of both RNA sequence and
                  structure, which is represented as a probability vector of
                  different RNA structural contexts; (ii) novel features in the
                  architecture of the networks, such as the application of RNNs
                  to RNA-binding prediction, and the combination of hundreds of
                  variable-length filters in the CNN. Our results in inferring
                  accurate RNA-binding models from high-throughput in vitro data
                  exhibit substantial improvements, compared to all previous
                  approaches for protein-RNA binding prediction (both DNN and
                  non-DNN based). A more modest, yet statistically significant,
                  improvement is achieved for in vivo binding prediction. When
                  incorporating experimentally-measured RNA structure, compared
                  to predicted one, the improvement on in vivo data increases.
                  By visualizing the binding specificities, we can gain
                  biological insights underlying the mechanism of protein
                  RNA-binding. Availability and implementation The source code

  abstract =     {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms
                  that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of
                  intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown
                  impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and
                  medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex
                  and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may
                  be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields.
                  We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of
                  biomedical problems\textemdash patient classification,
                  fundamental biological processes and treatment of
                  patients\textemdash and discuss whether deep learning will be
                  able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere
                  poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive
                  literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to
                  revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the
                  most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances
                  have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though
                  improvements over previous baselines have been modest in
                  general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning
                  methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding
                  human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a
                  specific neural network's prediction to input features,
                  understanding how users should interpret these models to make
                  testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an
                  open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled
                  data for training presents problems in some domains, as do
                  legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health
                  records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling
                  changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to
                  transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

                  supervised DNA motif prediction due to its excellent
                  performances. To employ CNN, the input DNA sequences are
                  required to be encoded as numerical values and represented as
                  either vectors or multi-dimensional matrices. This paper
                  evaluated a simple and more compact ordinal encoding method
                  versus the popular one-hot encoding for DNA sequences. We
                  compared the performances of both encoding methods using three
                  sets of datasets enriched with DNA motifs. We found that the
                  ordinal encoding performs comparable to the one-hot method but
                  with significant reduction in training time. In addition, the
                  one-hot encoding performances were rather consistent across
                  various datasets but would require suitable CNN configuration
                  to perform well. The ordinal encoding with matrix
                  representation performed best in some of the evaluated
                  datasets. This study implied that the performances of CNN for
                  DNA motif discovery depends on the suitable design of the
                  sequence encoding and representation. The good performances of

                  structural characterization of soluble proteins, membrane
                  proteins and diverse protein complexes, as of late, has
                  benefitted from computational approaches' contributions. These
                  would be essential in the case of membrane proteins. Due to
                  their near functional ubiquity and the difficulty of their
                  experimental study, the employment of structure prediction and
                  interface characterization computational methods allows for
                  broad and in-depth comprehension, fundamental if we realize
                  membrane proteins are key targets in the pharmaceutical
                  industry.In this master thesis, the works was divided in two
                  different but interconnect tasks: i) the understanding of a
                  typical example of membrane protein: G-coupled protein
                  receptor complexes and ii) the methodological development for
                  protein interaction characterization. As a results of the
                  first task we list all conclusions retrieved from the
                  modelling of complexes between GPCRs, arrestins and G-proteins
                  with the full assessment of the surface area inter-residual
                  distance, residue conservation, hydrogen bonds, among other
                  characteristics. Subsequently, we proceed to identify
                  substructures, regions, residue patterns and specific
                  residues' relevant for complex formation between GPCRs and
                  other proteins. The data was summarized under graphical
                  display and made available online (http://45.32.153.74/gpcr/).
                  In the second part, we focused on Machine Learning algorithms'
                  deployment in order to correctly classify protein interfacial
                  residues, which are crucial at a structural and functional
                  level: Hot-Spots. Based on experimental data and residue
                  feature collection, a Hot-Spot prediction model was built,

                  (http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/SPOTON/spoton/). We

                  cis-regulatory specific sub-regions of DNA promoters and
                  initiate transcription. Finding the exact location of these
                  binding sites (aka motifs) is important in a variety of
                  domains such as drug design and development. To address this
                  need, several in vivo and in vitro techniques have been
                  developed so far that try to characterize and predict the
                  binding specificity of a protein to different DNA loci. The
                  major problem with these techniques is that they are not
                  accurate enough in prediction of the binding affinity and
                  characterization of the corresponding motifs. As a result,
                  downstream analysis is required to uncover the locations where
                  proteins of interest bind. Here, we propose DeeperBind, a long
                  short term recurrent convolutional network for prediction of
                  protein binding specificities with respect to DNA probes.
                  DeeperBind can model the positional dynamics of probe
                  sequences and hence reckons with the contributions made by
                  individual sub-regions in DNA sequences, in an effective way.
                  Moreover, it can be trained and tested on datasets containing
                  varying-length sequences. We apply our pipeline to the

The input used stemmed from the protein sequence and structural features extracted from the protein pair. We evaluated the performance of DN-Fold along with 18 different methods on Lindahl's benchmark dataset and on a large benchmark set extracted from SCOP 1.75 consisting of about one million protein pairs, at three different levels of fold recognition (i.e., protein family, superfamily, and fold) depending on the evolutionary distance between protein sequences. The correct recognition rate of ensembled DN-Fold for Top 1 predictions is 84.5\%, 61.5\%, and 33.6\% and for Top 5 is 91.2\%, 76.5\%, and 60.7\% at family, superfamily, and fold levels, respectively. We also evaluated the performance of single DN-Fold (DN-FoldS), which showed the comparable results at the level of family and superfamily, compared to ensemble DN-Fold. Finally, we extended the binary classification problem of fold recognition to real-value regression task, which also show a promising performance.

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1\textendash 4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10\textendash 14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are widely distributed in proteins, which are associated with many biological processes and diseases. Accurate prediction of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions is critical for both basic research (such as protein structure and function prediction) and practical applications (such as drug development). During the past decades, many computational approaches have been proposed, which have greatly facilitated the development of this important field. Therefore, a comprehensive and updated review is highly required. In this regard, we give a review on the computational methods for intrinsically disordered protein and region prediction, especially focusing on the recent development in this field. These computational approaches are divided into four categories based on their methodologies, including physicochemical-based method, machine-learning-based method, template-based method and meta method. Furthermore, their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed. The performance of 40 state-of-the-art predictors is directly compared on the target proteins in the task of disordered region prediction in the 10th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction. A more comprehensive performance comparison of 45 different predictors is conducted based on seven widely used benchmark data sets. Finally, some open problems and perspectives are discussed.},

  abstract = {As high-throughput biological sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, the need to extract useful information from sequencing becomes ever more paramount, often limited by low-throughput experimental characterizations. For proteins, accurate prediction of their functions directly from their primary amino-acid sequences has been a long standing challenge. Here, machine learning using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment, heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease, ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of homologues for a wide range of protein functions.},

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether such tool can be used in order to define a set of descriptors useful for pattern recognition and machine learning tasks. Specifically, we consider a supervised learning problem with the final goal of predicting proteins' physiological function starting from their respective residue contact network. Indeed, folded proteins can effectively be described by graphs, making them a useful case-study for assessing Topological Data Analysis effectiveness concerning pattern recognition tasks. Experiments conducted on a subset of the Escherichia coli proteome using two different classification systems show that descriptors derived from Topological Data Analysis - namely, the Betti numbers sequence - lead to classification performances comparable with descriptors derived from widely-known centrality measures, as concerns the protein function prediction problem. Further benchmarking tests suggest the presence of some information despite the heavy compression intrinsic to the protein-to-Betti numbers casting.},

How the RBPs correctly recognize the target RNAs and why they bind specific positions is still far from clear. Machine learning-based algorithms are widely acknowledged to be capable of speeding up this process. Although many automatic tools have been developed to predict the RNA-protein binding sites from the rapidly growing multi-resource data, e.g. sequence, structure, their domain specific features and formats have posed significant computational challenges. One of current difficulties is that the cross-source shared common knowledge is at a higher abstraction level beyond the observed data, resulting in a low efficiency of direct integration of observed data across domains. The other difficulty is how to interpret the prediction results. Existing approaches tend to terminate after outputting the potential discrete binding sites on the sequences, but how to assemble them into the meaningful binding motifs is a topic worth of further investigation.},

  abstract = {A central tenet of biology is that globular proteins have a unique 3D structure under physiological conditions. Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that some proteins switch folds, a process that involves remodeling of secondary structure in response to a few mutations (evolved fold switchers) or cellular stimuli (extant fold switchers). To date, extant fold switchers have been viewed as rare byproducts of evolution, but their frequency has been neither quantified nor estimated. By systematically and exhaustively searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we found {$\sim$}100 extant fold-switching proteins. Furthermore, we gathered multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these proteins are widespread in nature. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesized that the frequency of extant fold-switching proteins may be underrepresented by the structures in the PDB. Thus, we sought to identify other putative extant fold switchers with only one solved conformation. To do this, we identified two characteristic features of our {$\sim$}100 extant fold-switching proteins, incorrect secondary structure predictions and likely independent folding cooperativity, and searched the PDB for other proteins with similar features. Reassuringly, this method identified dozens of other proteins in the literature with indication of a structural change but only one solved conformation in the PDB. Thus, we used it to estimate that 0.5\textendash 4\% of PDB proteins switch folds. These results demonstrate that extant fold-switching proteins are likely more common than the PDB reflects, which has implications for cell biology, genomics, and human health.},

This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory 'grammar' to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models. We have made the source code available at the github repository http://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Deep learning architectures have recently demonstrated their power in predicting DNA- and RNA-binding specificities. Existing methods fall into three classes: Some are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), others use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and others rely on hybrid architectures combining CNNs and RNNs. However, based on existing studies it is still unclear which deep learning architecture is achieving the best performance. Thus an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the different methods is needed to fully evaluate their relative. Results: In this study, We present a systematic exploration of various deep learning architectures for predicting DNA- and RNA-binding specificities. For this purpose, we present deepRAM, an end-to-end deep learning tool that provides an implementation of novel and previously proposed architectures; its fully automatic model selection procedure allows us to perform a fair and unbiased comparison of deep learning architectures. We find that an architecture that uses k-mer embedding to represent the sequence, a convolutional layer and a recurrent layer, outperforms all other methods in terms of model accuracy. Our work provides guidelines that will assist the practitioner in choosing the best architecture for the task at hand, and provides some insights on the differences between the models learned by convolutional and recurrent networks. In particular, we find that although recurrent networks improve model accuracy, this comes at the expense of a loss in the interpretability of the features learned by the model. Availability and implementation: The source code for deepRAM is available at https://github.com/MedChaabane/deepRAM},

  abstract = {For a protein to function appropriately, it must first achieve its proper conformation and location within the crowded environment inside the cell. Multiple chaperone systems are required to fold proteins correctly. In addition, degradation pathways participate by destroying improperly folded proteins. The intricacy of this multisystem process provides many opportunities for error. Furthermore, mutations cause misfolded, nonfunctional forms of proteins to accumulate. As a result, many pathological conditions are fundamentally rooted in the proteinfolding problem that all cells must solve to maintain their function and integrity. Here, to illustrate the breadth of this phenomenon, we describe five examples of protein-misfolding events that can lead to disease: improper degradation, mislocalization, dominant-negative mutations, structural alterations that establish novel toxic functions, and amyloid accumulation. In each case, we will highlight current therapeutic options for battling such diseases.},

  abstract = {Knowledge on protein folding has a profound impact on understanding the heterogeneity and molecular function of proteins, further facilitating drug design. Predicting the 3D structure (fold) of a protein is a key problem in molecular biology. Determination of the fold of a protein mainly relies on molecular experimental methods. With the development of next-generation sequencing techniques, the discovery of new protein sequences has been rapidly increasing. With such a great number of proteins, the use of experimental techniques to determine protein folding is extremely difficult because these techniques are time consuming and expensive. Thus, developing computational prediction methods that can automatically, rapidly, and accurately classify unknown protein sequences into specific fold categories is urgently needed. Computational recognition of protein folds has been a recent research hotspot in bioinformatics and computational biology. Many computational efforts have been made, generating a variety of computational prediction methods. In this review, we conduct a comprehensive survey of recent computational methods, especially machine learning-based methods, for protein fold recognition. This review is anticipated to assist researchers in their pursuit to systematically understand the computational recognition of protein folds.},

Noisy Student Training achieves 88.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 2.0\% better than the state-of-the-art model that requires 3.5B weakly labeled Instagram images. On robustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0\% to 83.7\%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces ImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2. Noisy Student Training extends the idea of self-training and distillation with the use of equal-or-larger student models and noise added to the student during learning. On ImageNet, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels for 300M unlabeled images. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by putting back the student as the teacher. During the learning of the student, we inject noise such as dropout, stochastic depth, and data augmentation via RandAugment to the student so that the student generalizes better than the teacher.

In parallel with the urgent demand for robust algorithms, deep learning has succeeded in a variety of fields such as vision, speech, and text processing. Yet genomics entails unique challenges to deep learning since we are expecting from deep learning a superhuman intelligence that explores beyond our knowledge to interpret the genome. A powerful deep learning model should rely on insightful utilization of task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we briefly discuss the strengths of different deep learning models from a genomic perspective so as to fit each particular task with a proper deep architecture, and remark on practical considerations of developing modern deep learning architectures for genomics. We also provide a concise review of deep learning applications in various aspects of genomic research, as well as pointing out current challenges and potential research directions for future genomics applications.},

  abstract = {The interactions between proteins and RNAs play essential roles in many important biological processes. While the detection of protein-RNA interaction by biological experiments is a laborious and time-consuming task, computational prediction tools are highly in need. The prediction performance of the computational tools rely on two factors, namely feature representation of RNA sequences and classification models. In the existing methods, statistical features or one-hot vectors are adopted, and most of the classifiers are traditional machine learning models, while the distributed representation and flexible deep learning architectures have not been exploited. Therefore, in this study, we represent RNA sequences by continuous distributed features, and propose a hybrid deep learning architecture, which combines both CNN and RNN. The experiments are conducted on 31 benchmark datasets, corresponding to 31 RNA-binding-proteins. The results show that the new method achieves obvious advantages against the existing methods on most of the datasets.},
